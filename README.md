# angle

Project made in 2017

This is a basic C# program that makes physics calculations about a body on a slope. The program calculates the Force on the body and its acceleration.
The program also includes GUI for inputing the data about the body and the slope and has a visual representation the body and slope using windows forms.

If you'll enter impossible inputs (negative mass, slope bigger than 90&deg;, text that can't be parsed into a number, etc.) the program will detect it and notify you.
